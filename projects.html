       <p>
         The Pacmen Exercise was the first project I ever made with JavaScript & HTML.
         This program has an easy to view color scheme and contains two buttons. The 
         first button unilizes a factory that produces a pacman with evry click. The 
         second button sets all existing and future pacmen into random motion. This 
         project is fairly simple but I chose to include it in my portfolio as reference
         to my how far I have progressed since beggining my developer career. To view 
         this project in my Github repository click the button below.

       <p>
         The Eye Movement Exercise has been one of my favorites so far! The prpgram is just
         a simple set of eyes with animated pupils that will follow your mousekey. It was a very
         fun project to build that I learned allot from. Since completion I have changed the 
         color scheme to green and gold. In the future I plan to add a mouth animation. To view

       <p>
       The Real Time Bus Tracker is my most resent project. This program displays a map of boston
       and shows the bus stops between MIT and Harvard one at a time, on a three second interval.
       This prosses begins only when the start button is pushed. I added my own personal touch to 
       this program by styling the background and start button. In the future I plan to add 
       aditional bus routes and stops. To view this project in my Github repository click the 
       button below.
